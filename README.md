# Win XP Desktop Simulator
Loved for its stability, aesthetics, and the memorable "Bliss" wallpaper.

This is my casual portfolio that I've developed to honor one of the most adorable OS's of the 2000's. This OS was part of my teenage years and because of this I felt very nostalgic while developing this project.

## Project stack: 
- Next.js v15 
- Tailwind CSS v3.4 
- Radix UI v2

## The main ideia is: 
- keeping developing the project using Next.js and its new
functionalities as much as possible. 
- keep the look and feel of the functinalities more Windows XP as possible

## The main features are: 
- taskbar with icons and real time clock 
- draggable desktop icons 
- draggable and resizable window**
- double click desktop icons to open window
- minimize, maximize and close window
- static start menu made using radix ui dropdown component
- functinal internet explorer window with address bar and go button (note: most of web sites does not allow to be rendered in an iframe due to security reasons)

> **not as I sigh for but functional

## Thanks
It's important to give the credits to: 
- the project https://github.com/boranbatuhan/xpmsn that helped me to understant how to use the correct box shadow for Windows XP border effects and where I got some icons. 
- the CodePen https://codepen.io/jkasun/pen/QrLjXP where the draggable and resizable functions were adapted

I hope you enjoy this project as much as I enjoyed developing it ❤️.
